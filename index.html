            <h1>Preamble</h1>
            On Browsers implemented according to the W3C spec there is no way to record without the browser showing no sign of it.
            This page does not show a technical exploit of WebRTC or a way to avoid the signs of showing up but instead ask,
            if there is a way to still record or to start to record <strong>while</strong> the user cannot see them.
            The user still has to click once, to allow the web app to access the microphone and the page still must stay open
            (but this should not be the problem since some users including me have multiple tabs open and leave them open for a few days while working on something the tab is related to)
        </article>

            <h1>Situation / Problem</h1>
            I want to test if it is possible, to access the cam and microphone without the user noticing it.
            WebRTC was implemented with concern to users being spied on.
            Browsers therefore always show, when there is a tab that accesses local media devices by showing a big red dot beside the favicon that marks a current record.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    On a desktop device, this may be highly visible since all tabs are beside each other.
                    On a mobile device, they are often displayed behind each other.
                    Therefore, a user should not notice if a tab records on mobile devices while being in the background.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A desktop browser cannot show any signs of microphone access, when the browser window is minimized.
                    Since the only display is on the tabs, not showing the tabs hides recording activity to the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, https-pages ask just once to get the users permission, subsequent calls to getUserMedia are accepted automatically if the user agreed.
                </li>
            </ol>

        </article>

            <h1>Exploitability</h1>
            First of all: This is not a security exploit but possibly a bad design choice that would result in a user not being aware of access to its local media.
            The recordings could be sent over Peer Connection to a MCU or over a Websocket to the server.
            Recordings on this page just stay on this page (but if it works, it would be possible to send them to a server)
        </article>
        <article>
            <h1>Results</h1>
            I tested my ideas about recording and hiding this activity.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    While the mobile browser never shows any tab symbol like its desktop equivalent, the smartphone shows on the system menu bar that the microphone is in use.
                    This makes it impossible to record while the user is completely unaware of it and has no chance to see any notifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no sign of a recording while the window is minimized but when the user maximizes his window again, the browsers still show the recording icon for a few seconds.
                    This makes it possible that the user notices the unwanted access to his microphone. Even if it may reduce the risk, this would not be enough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some browsers still ask every time getUserMedia is called
                </li>
            </ol>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h1>Consequences</h1>
            Sometimes, it is claimed that pages like facebook and google may listen to conversations over the users audio inputs.
            On a webpage, this would only be possible if the web app calls getUserMedia. My tests show the limited options to use this API for these intents.
            It would be way to probable that at least one user notices a sign of unwanted device access and the reputation of the web apps company would be ruined

    <div class="row">
        <h1>Code used</h1>
        <p>
            For the tab switching test I used the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-page-visibility-20131029/">Page visibility API</a> defined by the W3C to check if the tab is in Foreground or Background.
            To test if the window is minimized, I had to use the outerHeight of the window and poll if it changed to a value that indicated that the user minimized the browser window.
