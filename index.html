            <h1>Preamble</h1>
            It is important that webrtc recording is always visible to the user. Every big and trusted browser tries to show camera usage on its tabs.
            This page does not show a technical exploit of WebRTC or a way to avoid the browser showing these signs of recording,
            but instead poses the question, if there is a way to still record or to start recording <strong>while</strong> the user cannot see these signs.
            The user still has to accept the use of his cam at some point in any way, since there is no way to get access media without previous user agreement.
            After this, I will try to use a kind of trick to record sounds without UI representation of the media being accessed by the browser.

            <h1>Situation / Problem</h1>
            I want to test if it is possible to access the cam and microphone without the user noticing it.
            WebRTC was implemented with concern to users being spied on by a malicious page.
            Browsers therefore always show, when there is a tab that accesses local media devices by showing a big red dot beside the favicon that marks a current record.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    On a desktop device, this may be highly visible since all tabs are beside each other.
                    On a mobile device, they are often displayed behind each other. This could be used for the given problem,
                    but the mobile phone always shows microphone usage by its OS System bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A desktop browser cannot show any signs of microphone access, when the browser window is minimized.
                    Since the only display is on the tabs, not showing the tabs hides recording activity to the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, https-pages ask just once to get the users permission,
                    subsequent calls to getUserMedia are accepted automatically if the user agreed.
                    This can help, when the user reopens the malicious page and is not reminded that his media is being accessed.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Exploitability</h1>
            First of all: This is not a security exploit but possibly a bad design choice that would result in a user not being aware of access to its local media.
            The recordings could be sent over Peer Connection to a MCU or over a Websocket to the server.
            Recordings on this page just stay on this page (but if it works, it would be possible to send them to a server)
        </article>
        <article>
            <h1>Results</h1>
            I tested my ideas about recording and hiding this activity.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    While the mobile browser never shows any tab symbol like its desktop equivalent, the smartphone shows on the system menu bar that the microphone is in use.
                    This makes it impossible to record while the user is completely unaware of it and has no chance to see any notifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no sign of a recording while the window is minimized but when the user maximizes his window again, the browsers still show the recording icon for a few seconds.
                    This makes it possible that the user notices the unwanted access to his microphone. Even if it may reduce the risk, this would not be enough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some browsers still ask every time getUserMedia is called, so it is pretty much to risky to use webrtc to record users without their knowledge.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </article>

            <h1>Consequences</h1>
            Sometimes, it is claimed that pages like facebook and google may listen to conversations over the users audio inputs.
            On a webpage, this would only be possible if the web app calls getUserMedia. My tests show the limited options to use this API for these intents.
            It would be way to probable that at least one user notices a sign of unwanted device access and the reputation of the web apps company would be ruined
        </article>

    <div class="row">
        <h1>Code used</h1>
        <p>
            For the tab switching test I used the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-page-visibility-20131029/">Page visibility API</a> defined by the W3C to check if the tab is in Foreground or Background.
            To test if the window is minimized, I had to use the outerHeight of the window and poll if it changed to a value that indicated that the user minimized the browser window.
